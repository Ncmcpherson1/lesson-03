    <p>Healthy skin is in and with everything going on in the world having healthy skin can help make a difference in your overall well-being.  As a licensed Esthetician, one of the many concerns that I hear as of late are  “How do I clear up acne or irritation caused by wearing a mask?" As you may all know, wearing a mask is the New Norm and with that can come skin challenges. Clients often ask me about ways to protect their skin as well as how to relieve redness or irritation caused by wearing a mask all day. I'm also asked if it would be beneficial to limit the use of cosmetic make-up. Whether you have normal skin, Acne-proned skin, sensitive skin or aging skin a proper daily skincare routine is important to incorporate into your lifestyle. It doesn’t have to be a complex routine, nor am I asking you to invest in hundreds of dollars worth of skincare products or treatments either. I will say having a better knowledge of your skin and making tiny daily adjustments can help you to reach your skincare goals. So lets get into those "5 Easy Skincare Steps" and get you on your way to healthy happy skin! </p>
    <h2 style="background-color:white;">Step 1: Cleansing</h2>
    <p class="gill sans"> Cleansing is important to remove all oil/debris and make-up from your skin. There are a number of choices based on your skincare needs. If you have oily skin you may not want to invest in a hydrating or intensive moisture cleanser. Those cleanser work best for individuals that have dry or flaky and even tight or sensitive skin. One way to ensure you chose the right cleanser is by the consistency of the product. Foamy cleansers or ones that work up a great soapy lather are ideal for oily, normal or congested meaning acne-proned skin. Creamy cleansers are ideal for sensitive, dehydrated or flaky skin. But its important to review the product instructions because this may differ. 
        <h2 style="background-color:white;">Step 2: Exfoliate</h2>
        <p class="gill sans">Exfoliating is the best way to remove dead skin cells and speed up the cell renewal process of your skin. Some examples of exfoliating are gentle scrubs that can be paired with your cleanser or alone. Some exfoliants can be used daily or a few times a week. It’s always important to read directions and pay attention to how your skin feels and responds to any product your using.</p2>
        <h2 style="background-color:white;">Step 3: Mask</h2>
        <p class="gill sans">Wearing a mask once or twice a week that focuses on your skincare goals can boost your skin health. Some examples are Detoxifying, Rejuvenating or Hydrating Masks. Depending on the mask some instructions may direct you to apply 1-2 times a week or as needed.</p3>
        <h2 style="background-color:white;">Step 4: Eye treatment</h2>
        <p class="gill sans">Eye treatments are good to help firm, hydrate, correct and prevent the eye area from breaking down. The skin of the eye is the thinnest part of the face. You should apply your eye treatment in an upside down "U" shape about half an inch from the eye. Some eye treatments that include Vitamin-C are great for firming and brightening. Make sure to follow product instructions to know how often to incorporate your eye treatment</p4>
        <h2 style="background-color:white;">Step 5: Moisturize/SPF </h2>
        <p class="gill sans">Moisturizing/SPF is the most important step. Protecting your skin from the environment and creating a barrier between your face while also hydrating your skin can slow down the aging process and prevent dehydration. You can individually purchase moisturizers and SPF’s. Some are dual products that include both moisturizer and SPF which I think are wonderful choices for individuals that like to cut time in half. Your skin condition will determine what moisturizer or SPF strength is best for you. If you have oily skin you don’t want to use a product that is oil-based. A lot of people love a daytime moisturizer that is light and an evening moisturizer that is thicker. There are many options on the market that will fit your daily and skincare needs!</p5>
        <h3 style="background-color:white;">Helpful Tips!</h3>
        <p class="gill sans"><meta charset="UTF-8">•	If you’re unsure of your skin type or you’re unsure of the best products for your skin then I would suggest you stop by your local spa/cosmetic store and speak with a Skincare Specialist. Dermalogica is a Professional Grade Skincare Product line that has a lot of tools and tips and even experts that can assist you online and in select locations. Cosmetic Stores also have Skincare Consultants that can answer and assist with many concerns and help you to chose the best products for you! The internet is also a wonderful source to get tips and advice as well.

        <h3></h3>
        <p class="gill sans"7><meta charset="UTF-8">•	A little bit goes a long way especially when choosing a Professional Skincare Line. Using more of a product does not ensure a quick fix! Pay close attention to product instructions. Too much of a product on your face can actually work against you. But that’s another topic for another day. So if the instructions call for a pea-sized amount then of course a quarter sized amount will result in wasting your product and over use. So manage this well!</p7>
        <h3></h3>
        <p class="gill sans"><meta charset="UTF-8">•	Serums and toners are your friend. There are also many serums and toners on the market that can help with hydrating, firming and treating acne. You can incorporate this step into your routine. Toners are meant to feel soothing and hydrating to the skin and many come with additional benefits. Toners can be used all day and may even be used as a make-up setter. The true purpose of a Toner is product penetration so anything applied to the skin that you want to be absorbed should be used after the toner is applied. Toners can be sprayed on making it easier to use. Don’t confuse Toners with Astringents they are not the same.</p8>
        <h3></h3>
        <p class="gill sans"><meta charset="UTF-8">•	The most important tip that I can leave you with is read instructions, ingredients and pay attention to your skin! If something isn’t working well for you then discontinue use. A before and after picture can help you to see the changes in your skin and keep you encouraged! More than likely the compliments you receive will suffice! </p9>
